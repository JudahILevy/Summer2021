For my solution, after loading the json file into the program, I stored the data in a 2D array. I created a list of all the team names, and for each team in that list, I extracted their number of wins against each of the other teams (using the same list of teams to extract the data from the json file). Since the records were given in alphabetical order of opponent, I could simply use a nested loop to store the data in the 2D array, knowing that when the two indices of the loops were equal, I should store a placeholder value in that spot in the array, since that spot in the grip represents the teams' record against itself. I displayed the matrix using a basic for loop. 
Simply run the WinLoss.py file to print the grid.
